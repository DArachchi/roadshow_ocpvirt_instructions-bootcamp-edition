=  Migration Toolkit Virtualization

== Introduction

You can migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere or Red Hat Virtualization to OpenShift Virtualization with the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).

. MTV supports cold migration from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and warm migration from VMware vSphere and from RHV.

. Cold migration: the default migration type. The source virtual machines are shut down while the data is copied.

. Warm migration: Most of the data is copied during the precopy stage while the source virtual machines (VMs) are running. Then the VMs are shut down and the remaining (much smaller) dataset is copied during the cutover stage.

More information in the following link: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.4/html-single/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/index#about-mtv

== Prerequisites for VMWare Provider

////
The firewalls must enable traffic over the following ports:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|*Port*|*Protocol*|*Source*|*Destination*|*Purpose*
|443|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware vCenter|VMware provider inventory
Disk transfer authentication
|443|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware ESXi hosts|Disk transfer authentication
|902|TCP|OpenShift nodes|VMware ESXi hosts|Disk transfer data copy
|===
////

The following prerequisites apply to all migrations:

* ISO/CDROM disks must be unmounted.
* Each NIC must contain one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[Guest operating system with OpenShift Virtualization].
* VM names must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), or hyphens (-), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (.), or special characters.
* VM names must not duplicate the name of a VM in the OpenShift Virtualization environment.

*Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* automatically assigns a new name to a VM that does not comply with the rules. *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* makes the following changes when it automatically generates a new VM name:

* Excluded characters are removed.
* Uppercase letters are switched to lowercase letters.
* Any underscore (_) is changed to a dash (-).

This feature allows a migration to proceed smoothly even if migrating a VM whose name that does not follow the rules.

== Migrating Virtual Machines from VMWare

A three-tier application has been deployed on VMware for you to migrate to OpenShift.

The application consists of the following four virtual machines:

* One proxy system redirecting traffic to the web servers
* Two Windows Servers with IIS + PHP Application connecting to the database
* One Linux system running a MariaDB database

// WKTBD: Replace with actual link for each student
Application is access from the following link: http://webapp.vc.opentlc.com/

You will migrate three of the four virtual machines - you will not need to migrate the proxy (load balancer) VM because OpenShift handles network traffic and load balancing on its own.

=== Review VMware environment

// WKTBD: Replace with link to student's individual account
. Navigate to link:https://portal.vc.opentlc.com/ui/app/folder;nav=v/urn:vmomi:Folder:group-v16081:ee1bef3e-6179-4c1f-9d2a-004c7b0df4e5/vms/vms[https://portal.vc.opentlc.com^]

// WKTBD: replace with student's credentials
. Login with the user `%vcenter_user%@vc.opentlc.com` and the password `%vcenter_password%`

. Review the existing VMs

[NOTE]
The VMs with suffix `_running` are the active ones. As for the migration have to be stopped, a clone of the VMs were created for the migration. Those VMs are the ones without that suffix.

=== Add VMWare Provider

The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* (*MTV*) uses the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (*VDDK*) SDK to transfer virtual disks from VMware vSphere. This VDDK has already been set up for you in this environment.

But you do need to register your VMware system to the Mitration Toolkit for Virtualizations as a new provider.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Providers for virtualization*
. Select project `openshift-mtv`
+
image::images/MTV/91_MTV_Providers.png[]

. By default, there is a provider called `host` which represents the *OpenShift Virtualization* as a target platform
+
image::images/MTV/92_MTV_Provider_list.png[]

. Press *Create Provider* button in the top right. A dialog it will appear.
+
image::images/MTV/93_MTV_Create_Provider.png[]

// WKTBD: replace with student's credentials
. Select *VMware* on the *Provider type* dropdown and fill the following data:
.. *Name*: `vmware`
.. *vCenter host name or IP address*: `portal.vc.opentlc.com`
.. *vCenter user name*: `%vcenter_user%`
.. *vCenter password*: `%vcenter_password%`
.. *VDDK init image*: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/vddk:latest`
.. Check `Skip certificate validation (if checked, the provider's certificate won't be validated)`
.. *SHA-1 fingerprint*: `70:2D:52:D2:D1:A5:A2:75:58:8F:3D:07:D5:7E:E9:73:81:BC:88:A2`
+
image::images/MTV/94_MTV_Fill_Dialog.png[]
.  Press *Create* and wait till the *Status* column is changed to `Ready`
+
image::images/MTV/95_MTV_Provider_Added.png[]

Now MTV knows about your VMware vSphere environment and can connect to it.

=== Create Storage and Network Mapping

Storage and Networking are handled slightly differently in VMware vSphere and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Therefore it is necesssary to create a (simple) mapping from the environments in VMware vSphere to what's available in OpenShift. This mapping will then be used to translate the VMware vSphere network and storage definitions to OpenShift network and storage definitions.

Usually you have to set up the mappings just once and then reuse these mappings for subsequent VM Migration Plans.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *NetworkMaps for virtualization* and press *Create NetworkMap*
+
image::images/MTV/96_MTV_NetworkMaps.png[]

. Fill the following information in the appeared dialog
.. *Name*: `mapping-segment`
.. *Source provider*: `vmware`
.. *Target provider*: `host`
.. *Source networks*: `segment-migrating-to-ocpvirt`
.. *Target network*: `Pod network (default)`
. Press *Create*
+
image::images/MTV/97_Add_VMWARE_Mapping_Network.png[]
. Ensure the created mapping has the correct *Status*
+
image::images/MTV/98_List_VMWARE_Mapping_Network.png[]

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *StorageMaps for virtualization* and press *Create StorageMap*
+
image::images/MTV/99_MTV_StorageMaps.png[]

. Fill the following information:
.. *Name*: `mapping-datastore`
.. *Source provider*: `vmware`
.. *Target provider*: `host`
.. *Source storage*: `WorkloadDatastore`
.. *Target storage classs*: `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd (default)`
. Press *Create*
+
image::images/MTV/100_Add_VMWARE_Mapping_Storage.png[]

. Ensure the created mapping has the correct *Status*
+
image::images/MTV/101_List_VMWARE_Mapping_Storage.png[]

=== Create Migration Plan

Now that you have the virtualization provider and the two mappings (Network & storage) you can create a Migration Plan - this plan selects which VMs to migrate from VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and how to execute the migration (Cold / Warm / Network Mapping / Storage Mapping / Pre- / Post-Hooks etc.)

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Plans for virtualization* and press *Create plan*
+
image::images/MTV/102_Create_VMWARE_Plan.png[]

. On the wizard fill the following information on the *General settings* step
.. *Plan name*: `move-webapp-vmware`
.. *Source provider*: `vmware`
.. *Target provider*: `host`
.. *Target namespace*: `vmexamples`
. Press *Next*
+
image::images/MTV/52_General_VMWARE_Plan.png[]
. On the next step, select `All datacenters`  and press *Next*
+
image::images/MTV/53_VM_Filter_VMWARE_Plan.png[]
. On the next step select the VMs `winweb01`, `winweb02` and `database`. Press *Next*:
+
image::images/MTV/54_VM_Select_VMWARE_Plan.png[]

. On the *Network mapping* step select `mapping-segment` and press *Next*
+
image::images/MTV/55_Network_VMWARE_Plan.png[]
. On the *Storage mapping* step select `mapping-datastore` and press *Next*
+
image::images/MTV/56_Storage_VMWARE_Plan.png[]
. Press *Next* on the steps *Type* and *Hooks*
. Review the configuration specified and press *Finish*
+
image::images/MTV/57_Finish_VMWARE_Plan.png[]

. Ensure the status for the plan is *Ready*
+
image::images/MTV/58_Ready_VMWARE_Plan.png[]

. Press *Start* to begin the migration of the three VMs.

. After around 10 minutes the migration is completed

=== Review and configure migrated Virtual Machines

Your VMs have now been migrated and could be started on OpenShift Virtualization. You could connect to the VM consoles and interact with them as you would have in VMware vCenter.

However the VMs are not connected to each other yet - this is because networking works a little bit different in OpenShift Container Platform.

A load balancer on OpenShift is called a *Service*. You will create this service shortly. But the service selects the recipients of the traffic that it load balances via so called label selectors. Now your VMs do not have that label yet.

So in order to connect your VMs you need to do the following:
* Add a label to your VMs (same label to both Windows IIS servers because they are both behind the same load balancer)
* Create the service to make the two Windows IIS servers available for other workloads on the cluster.
* Make the service available outside of OpenShift (by creating what's called a *Route*).

. Return to the OpenShift Console to add additional configuration to the migrated virtual machines.
. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* and ensure the migrated VMs exist and are running.
+
image::images/MTV/60_VMWARE_VMs_List.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure you select the project `vmexamples`
====

. Access to the `winweb01` and navigate to the *YAML* tab
. Find the `spec:` section and under the `template.metadata` add the following lines to label the VM resources:
+
[%nowrap]
----
      labels:
        env: webapp
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to get the indentation exactly right - just like in the screenshot below.
====
+
image::images/MTV/61_VMWARE_VMs_YAML.png[]

. *Repeat* the process for the VM `winweb02`.

. Start the _Virtual Machines_ `database`, `winweb01` and `winweb02`
.. Ensure the VMs are properly working, accessing to the Console tab of each VM.

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Services* and press *Create service*. Remember the label that you added to your VMs (`env=webapp`)? Here you see that the Service uses that label in its selector to pick which VMs to route traffic to.
. Replace the YAML with the following definition
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp
  namespace: vmexamples
spec:
  selector:
    env: webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
----
. Press *Create*.
. Now the Windows IIS are accessible from within the OpenShift Cluster. Since these are web servers you do however need to make the service available from outside of the cluster.
+
Navigate to *Routes* in the left menu
. Press *Create Route* and fill the following information:
.. *Name*: `route-webapp`
.. *Service*: `webapp`
.. *Target port*: `80 -> 80 (TCP)`
. Press *Create*
+
[NOTE]
====
Don't enable TLS.
====
+
image::images/MTV/63_VMWARE_VMs_Create_Route.png[]

. Navigate to the address shown in *Location* field
+
image::images/MTV/64_VMWARE_VMs_URL.png[]

. You see an error. This is because the Windows web servers are not able to resolve the internal name `database` to connect to the database VM.
+
It's rather easy to fix this connectivity issue. You just need to create another service in front of the database VM to make the database available within the OpenShift cluster. Note that because this database does *not* need to be (or even should not be) accessible from outside of the OpenShift environment you do not need to create a route for this service.

. Creating a service, allows resolve internally the DNS inside the namespace.
. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Services* and press *Create service*
. Replace the YAML with the following definition
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: database
  namespace: vmexamples
spec:
  selector:
    vm.kubevirt.io/name: database
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example the service is simply using the selector of VM's name. This is a default label that is automatically added to your database VM based on the name that the VM has. Also since there is only one VM the service does not need to load balance to your database.
====

. Reload the webapp URL and expect to get the proper result

== Summary

In this module you explored how to migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You have migrated a web application containing two Windows systems and a Linux system. You used the OpenShift features to provide networking access to the application and you learned to create services to provide access internal in the project.
