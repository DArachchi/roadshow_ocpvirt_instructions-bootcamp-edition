== Introduction

In this lab, you will review the environment to be used during this Workshop.

.Goals
* Explore the nodes and machines in your *Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform* cluster
// * Learn the basic concepts of *Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform*

== Review Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster

In this section you will explore the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment that has been provided for you. This environment runs on Bare Metal hosts in the Equinix cloud. You will understand how the nodes in this cluster are configured and which hardware capabilities they have.

=== Review Nodes and Machines

Almost every interaction with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can be done in the OpenShift Console. The console is a full featured web application that allows administrators and users alike to use the platform in a guided manner. Wizards are provided for most tasks which makes it easy to administer the system - and in our case create and managed virtual machines.

. Navigate to %ocp_url% and login with user `admin` and the password `%ocp_password%`.

. From the navigation menu, select *Compute* -> *Nodes*:

+
There are three control planes and three workers in the OpenShift 4 Cluster. In addition, the `ipmi` (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is being used to manage the bare-metal nodes.
+
A node is a virtual or bare-metal machine in an OpenShift cluster. Worker nodes host your application containers, grouped as pods. The control plane nodes run services that are required to control the OpenShift cluster.

. Click in one of the worker nodes to obtain resource information about the node:

+
The *Overview* tab is showing useful information about the utilization of the resources, such as CPU or memory. It also shows all the applications (*Pods*) that are running inside on this node. 

. Navigate to the tab *Details* to obtain more information about the operating system.

=== Review Bare Metal hosts

When using `Baseboard Management Console (BMC)` it is possible to manage the nodes using the *Red Hat OpenShift Platform* console. 

. Select *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*:
+

+
During the installation the *Control Plane* nodes are provisioned (that is why the status is `Externally privioned`) and when the cluster is ready, the *Worker* nodes are provisioned (status `Provisioned`). It is possible scale up easily the cluster with new hosts through the button *Add Host*.

. Click in any of the worker nodes to obtain information about the physical (bare-metal) node:
+

+
The information shown is simillar to the *Nodes* one, with the exception is providing information related to the hardware and the physical status of the baremetal node. Using the *Actions* menu is possible to operate with the baremetal host, being possible to restart or stop the system using `BMC`.

== Summary

In this lab, you became familiar with your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the hardware that makes up this environment.
