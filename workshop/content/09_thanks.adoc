== Thanks for attending the OpenShift Virtualization Roadshow

During this session you learned the basics of OpenShift Virtualization and how to create and administer Virtual Machines.

You also used the Migration Toolkit for Virtualizatopn to easily move a few virtual machines from VMware vSpherer to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
